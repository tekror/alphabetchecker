# Alphabet Checker
### A program that provides various statistics about a body of text entered by the user

#### The web version of Alphabet Checker is the two files located in the root directory of the project.
#### Within the 'reddit' directory is my original Alphabet Checker project.
#### It was originally designed as a bot for Reddit using Node.js and various modules.
#### The program goes to the requested subreddit, finds the current top post, finds the top comment of that post, and replies to the user's comment with various facts and statistics about the user's comment, as well as more stats about their top 100 comments.
#### Whilst this was an excellent lesson in learning the ropes of Node.js, I quickly learned the users of Reddit don't like being presented with a stack of random statistics, so I opted for the web interface instead.
#### It is also worth noting that the web tool works incredibly well on significantly large amounts of text, and has no serious lag involved
